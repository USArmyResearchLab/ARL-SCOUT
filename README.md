#  ARL SCOUT: The Situated Corpus of Understanding Transactions

The Situated Corpus Of Understanding Transactions (SCOUT) is a multi-modal collection of human-robot dialogue in the task domain of collaborative exploration. The corpus was constructed from multi-phased Wizard-of-Oz experiments where human participants gave verbal instructions to a remotely-located robot to move and gather information about its surroundings. Each dialogue involved a human Commander, a Dialogue Manager (DM), and a Robot Navigator (RN), and took place in physical or simulated environments.

SCOUT contains **Transcripts** of human-robot dialogues, aligned with the **Images** taken by the robot at the request of the Commander. The transcripts have been annotated with **Dialogue Structure**, including Transcaction Units (TUs), Antecedents, and Relations. A subset of utterances have been annotated with **Dialogue Semantics** including Standard-AMR and Dialogue-AMR. A subset of the **Maps** have been curated that depict the LIDAR Maps at the end of the dialogue and have been annotated as Exploration Maps.

## Experimental Design

Our human-robot collaboration exercise is an exploration-and-search task in which human participants (who assume the role of 'Commander') work with their remotely-located robot teammate to explore an unknown area under low-bandwidth conditions--a situation representative of various inhospitable remote environments. This constraint prevents live-video streaming of the robot's perspective to the human or remote teleoperation of the robot.

In the first three experiments, robot control was conducted through ‚ÄúWizard-of-Oz‚Äù (WoZ) methodology. One Wizard handled the robot's dialogue understanding and processing capabilities as the Dialogue Manager (DM) Wizard, and the other handled the robot's movement as the Robot Navigator (RN) Wizard.

The DM-Wizard listened to the participant's speech and generated text-based responses and resolved miscommunication in what is called the left conversational floor. Once the DM-Wizard deemed a participant's instruction was well-formed, the DM-Wizard translated the instruction into a more rigid natural language instruction and passed it to the RN-Wizard to execute. This took place in the right conversational floor, where only the DM-Wizard and RN-Wizard communicated. The RN-Wizard informed the DM-Wizard through spoken language to indicate completion or complication in executing an instruction; the DM-Wizard in turn informed the participant of this completion or complication via text.

The roles of dialogue manager and robot navigator changed over the course of the experimentation, from Wizard-of-Oz confederates to fully automated systems building upon the prior experimental findings.

| | Experiment 1 | Experiment 2 | Experiment 3 | Experiment 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dialogue Processing | wizard + keyboard | wizard + button GUI | wizard + button GUI | ASR + auto-DM |
| Robot Behaviors | wizard + joystick | wizard + joystick | wizard + joystick | wizard + joystick | 
| Robot & Environment | physical | physical | virtual | virtual |

Commanders were given three resources: a robot, a map, and photographs. The robot, a Clearpath Jackal, was located in a remote environment, and it could understand spoken, natural language instructions from the participant (via the DM and RN). The verbal instructions were issued to the robot through a push-to-talk interface, and the robot responded through text messages. The map was a 2D, birds-eye view LIDAR map of the environment, which dynamically updated as the robot moved through the space. The photos were taken from the robot's front-facing RGB camera, showing the view directly in front of it. Below is a screenshot of the view seen by the human Commander.

## SCOUT Contents

Unique Commanders (human participants) are named as `p{exp}.{ID}` where `{exp}` is the experiment number (1-4) and `{ID}` is the Commander's ID assigned within that experiment. For example, the Commander `p1.01` is the first Commander in Experiment 1. Each Commander completed three trials {train, main1, main2}. The `data/main_trial_distribution.xlsx` file notes which counting task was completed in each main trial.

The data and annotation files are divided by type over five directories with the `data/` directory of this repository:

- [Transcripts](https://github.com/USArmyResearchLab/ARL-SCOUT/tree/main/scout_contents.md#transcripts)
- [iSCOUT (images)](https://github.com/USArmyResearchLab/ARL-SCOUT/tree/main/scout_contents.md#iscout)
- [Maps](https://github.com/USArmyResearchLab/ARL-SCOUT/tree/main/scout_contents.md#maps)
- [Dialogue Structure](https://github.com/USArmyResearchLab/ARL-SCOUT/tree/main/scout_contents.md#dialogue-structure)
- [AMR (Dialogue Semantics)](https://github.com/USArmyResearchLab/ARL-SCOUT/tree/main/scout_contents.md#amr)
